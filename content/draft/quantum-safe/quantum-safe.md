# Security in a post-quantum world


Quantum can

* Break an asymmetric key (shor's algorithm) (NIST quantum-safe keys)

Quantum sometimes can

* Break symetric keys (grover's alogorithm)
* Break password hashing
* Decrypt existing data

Quantum cannot

* Defeat quantum-safe asymetric keys
* Decrypt data that doesn't exist
* Dereference tokens
* Penetrate firewalls
