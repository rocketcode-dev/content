# Privacy policy

Thomas Wilkinson values your privacy as much as he values his own and
protects the privacy of this site's users.

Currently, this site does not collect personal information and does not share
information with third parties. Future features may require collecting data to
make them usable. Generally, this site only uses personal data as necessary to
provide value to the user, and intends to be transparent about how the data is
used.

## What I collect

Currently, the main site does not have any means to collect personal information
about its users. This may change without notice in the near future.

The site does collect analytics data to give its creator insight into the most
popular content, referrers, and "stickiness" of the content on the site. This
data may be linked to a device by using an opt-in cookie.

## What I share

This site does not share data with third parties. Analytics services are
provided in-house and not shared with third parties.

This may change without notice in the future as more features are added.
